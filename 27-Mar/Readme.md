# Lab 9: Semantic Net Reification

This lab explores the reification of verbs in a semantic net, enriching relationships between entities.

## Overview

- Identify entities and verbs.
- Draw a simple semantic net.
- Reify verbs, expanding them into separate relationships.
- Draw the reified semantic net.

## Key Steps

1. **Entity and Verb Identification:** Identify entities and verbs in provided sentences.
2. **Simple Semantic Net:** Create a basic semantic net with entities as nodes and relationships as edges.
3. **Reification of Verbs:** Expand verbs into separate relationships involving additional entities.
4. **Reified Semantic Net:** Visualize the reified relationships in the semantic net.

## Conclusion

Reification enhances the semantic net, providing a more detailed representation of relationships between entities.
